                        Prime Minister Narendra Modi did no special favour to farmers by releasing the PM-Kisan Samman
                        Nidhi fund, which was due to them a month ago but delayed by the poll code, the Congress said on
                        June 10.


                        Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said the release of the 17th instalment of funds, which
                        Mr. Modi is touting as the first decision of his new government, is the legitimate entitlement
                        due to farmers, according to the policy of his government.

                        PM KISAN Yojana | FM Nirmala Sitharaman says 11.8 crore farmers receive financial assistance

                        If he is genuinely concerned about farmers, the Prime Minister should grant legal status to
                        minimum support price (MSP) for their produce, announce a farm loan waiver and provide
                        guaranteed insurance payment directly into their bank accounts, he said.

                        <p> Taking charge as Prime Minister in his third term, Mr. Modi on June 10 signed his first file
                            authorising the release of the 17th instalment of the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi fund, amounting
                            to
                            nearly ₹20,000 crore that will benefit around 9.3 crore farmers.

                            After signing on to the release of the fund, Mr. Modi said, "Ours is a government fully
                            committed to 'kisan kalyan [farmers' welfare]'. It is, therefore, fitting that the first
                            file
                            signed on taking charge is related to it. We want to keep working even more for farmers and
                            the
                            agriculture sector in the times to come." Mr. Ramesh alleged that the Prime Minister made a
                            "great show" of signing his first file upon taking office — granting the 17th instalment of
                            the
                            PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi funds.
                            "Aap chronology samajhiye: The 16th instalment of PM Kisan Nidhi was due in January 2024 but
                            was
                            delayed by a month for the Prime Minister's electoral calculus … The 17th instalment of PM
                            Kisan
                            Nidhi was due in April/May 2024 but was delayed by the enforcement of the Model Code of
                            Conduct," he said in a post on X.</p>
